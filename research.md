# Research

We are dedicated to advancing knowledge through multidisciplinary approaches, integrating fields such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), approximate computing, and embedded systems. Explore our primary research areas below.

## Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

### Impact of Large Language Models in Educational VR Environments
We evaluate the use of off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT to assess their impact on learning outcomes within educational Virtual Reality (VR) settings. Our studies focus on enhancing immersive educational experiences through intelligent, responsive systems.

### Controlling NPCs in Game Environments with LLMs
This project explores the integration of LLMs to manage Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in gaming environments. By leveraging advanced language models, we aim to create more dynamic and realistic interactions, enhancing player engagement and experience.

### Collaboration with the Psychology Department: Exposure Therapy in VR with Integrated AI Agents
In partnership with the Psychology Department, we are developing VR-based exposure therapy programs augmented with AI-driven agents. This interdisciplinary project seeks to improve therapeutic outcomes by providing adaptive and personalized treatment environments.

## Approximate Computing and Embedded Devices

### Post-Training Evaluation of LLMs and Neural Networks on Embedded Devices
We investigate the deployment of Large Language Models and neural networks on embedded systems using approximate computing techniques. This research aims to optimize performance and energy efficiency without compromising model accuracy, enabling advanced AI capabilities in resource-constrained environments.

### Fairness Evaluation in Medical Datasets
Our work in this area focuses on assessing the fairness of AI models applied to medical datasets, such as dermatology images. We examine model performance across diverse demographic groups to ensure equitable healthcare outcomes and mitigate biases in AI-driven medical diagnostics.
